## Image Carousel LAB

###Goal:
* The goal of this lab is to write code that reacts to events and uses animation. It is also a good opportunity to practice various JavaScript debugging strategies.

### The Image Carousel:
* For an example, check out the [Twitter Bootstrap Carousel](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel)
* We are going to rebuild this from scratch.
* Add event listeners for mouseover and mouseexit to change the opacity of the next and previous buttons.
* Implement toLeft and toRight functions that will move the margin to display either the next or previous image.
* add a slide show button that automatically cycles through the images

### Bonus
* Get the animation working so that the images slide across rather than just appearing
